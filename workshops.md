## HTTP security headers


This is a 4-hour practical technical workshop for engineers on using [HTTP security headers](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project)
to improve client side security on the web.


- **Duration:** 4 hours (1.5h of theory / 2.5h of lab work)
- **Target audience:** web developers (backend, frontend); system administrators who work with web servers; web testers; security specialists
- **Expected outcome:** Participants are aware on available client side HTTP security controls; what protections they provide; and how to configure them. Participants have needed basics to start implementing learnings in their production applications.

The training consists of 90 minutes of theory and 150 minutes of hands on lab work, where participants have to apply learnings to secure a real website.

#### Topics covered

- CSP (Content Security Policy)
- Cookie security
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- HTTPS redirects, the correct way
- Referrer Policy
- Feature Policy
- Subresource Integrity; supply chain security
- Expect-CT; Certificate Transparency
- Deprecated security headers
- XSS and browser-based protection against it

## Workshop audience

The workshops are directed towards technology professionals: programmers, devops engineers, full-stack engineers, frontend engineers, system
administrators, security engineers and testers.

All workshops are for in-person sessions only, ie no remote video participants. This is to enable effective communication and support from the trainer
during practical labs.

## Price

Price of the workshop is for the full training session and isn't affected by the number of participants (although workshops have minimum and maximum
participant limits). The price of a single training is generally greatly smaller than sending the participants to a similar trainining individually.

Price can be affected by availability, special requests and travel expenses (if any). Participants get training materials (slides and any extra supporting material, if any)
after the training and are welcome to use it internally.
