Since the invention of e-mail, geeky people have found various creative and sometimes annoying ways to notify themselves of a new mail in their inbox.


Say, for example, that you have a roomie who left his laptop locked and the volume up and it just so happens that he had a very vocal Indian dude announcing his full inbox every 3 minutes.

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Hack into said roomies computer</li>
<li>Step 2: Locate and download said MP3 announcement file</li>
<li>Step 3: Modify the file to your liking <a href="http://sqroot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/west.wav">or download mine</a></li>
<li>Step 4: Replace the old MP3 file with your better version</li>
<li>Step 5: Profit</li>
</ul>
