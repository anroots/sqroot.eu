<p>A picture says more than a thousand words... (Don&#039;t believe that? <a href="http://twitpic.com/3l5v46">Try describing this picture of Katersoneseven</a> accurately, relaying every detail).</p>
<p>I was recently chastised for not using any/not enough emoticons in my MSN conversations. Indeed, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley" rel="wikipedia" title="Smiley">smileys</a> help to relay the current mood much better than words and so I borrowed some (<a class="zem_slink" href="http://pidgin.im/" rel="homepage" title="Pidgin (software)">Pidgin</a>&#039;s default ones aren&#039;t really pretty) from my friend and made myself use them.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I didn&#039;t really feel like typing and thought that I could express my opinion with only emoticons. This is what happened, I actually laughed out loud.</p>
