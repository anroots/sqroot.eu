<p>Inspired by&nbsp;<a href="http://threewords.me/">http://threewords.me/</a>, I thought it would be a good idea to push the thought a bit further.</p>
<p>The website should look Web 2.0-ish, with a clear and big GUI, AJAX and simple eye-candy. The website let&#039;s the user to setup a page where people with the link are presented with a list (grid) of checkboxes with different adjectives (some pre-defined, users can add more to the database). These visitors pick adjectives that, in their opinion, best describe the user whose page they are currently viewing.</p>
<p>The user can later see a summary of the results and optionally publish it.</p>
<p>Keywords: Integration with Facebook, Twitter, clean and simple, minimal page refreshes, minimal time setting up, modern web technologies, pretty GUI</p>
