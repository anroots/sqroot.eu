<p>I get these crazy ideas sometimes...</p>
<p>I was impressed by the scene in <a class="zem_slink" title="The Social Network" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/" rel="imdb">The Social Network</a> where Mr. <a class="zem_slink" title="Mark Zuckerberg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" rel="wikipedia">Zuckerberg</a>Â wrote a small program to download hundreds of (girl) pictures to make a site called facematch.com. I knew three things allready:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had seen <a href="http://wiki.itcollege.ee/index.php/ITK_m%C3%A4rguandja">a simple shell script to login to a webpage</a> that I knew I could easily modify even through I had almost 0 experience with it.</li>
<li>I knew our college website made the pictures readily available to logged in users</li>
<li>I had about an hours worth of free time tonight.</li>
</ol>
<p>An hour later I had this script and a folder with about 500 thumbnails.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2656998.js?file=itk-downloader.sh"></script><br />
I didn't bother with any fancy config options or downloading every picture, this was ment as a proof of consept. Now all I need to do is write some PHP to make my very own facematch.com! <span style="color: #a9a9a9;">(Naah, I've got better things to do.)</span></p>
