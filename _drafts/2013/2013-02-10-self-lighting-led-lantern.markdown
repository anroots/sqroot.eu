<p>Finally got the components for my next practice-project, <a href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2007/a-simple-and-cheap-dark-detecting-led-circuit/">A Simple and Cheap Dark-Detecting LED Circuit</a> by Windell.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a simple circuit that contains a LED and a light-sensor (amongst others). The LED lights when the sensor doesn't receive enough light. This is awesome for LED throwbies (longer graffiti power!), but also for other uses.</p>
<p>I plan to make two of those: red, glowing evil eyes that turn on by themselves when you switch off the light. They are a geeky gift to my mother, who can then craft them into a cute/evil toy body. I'm thinking a rat.</p>
<p>Assembling the circuit was fun and made me interested in the science behind it. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tyler_dewitt_hey_science_teachers_make_it_fun.html">If only my high school physics course had been this awesome</a>... The components I used cost about 3â‚¬; easily obtainable for a physics lab.</p>
