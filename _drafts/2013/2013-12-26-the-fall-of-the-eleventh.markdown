<p>Spoilers!</p>
<p>The Eleventh Doctor is gone.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  He turned round again, arms outstretched, face calmer and more peaceful than perhaps it'd ever been.</p>
<p>  'We all change,' he said softly, and it was like he was easing a great weight off his chest as he spoke. His expression took on that of a man who had so much wisdom, who had seen so much, that it was hard not to fall right there. 'When you think about it, we are all different people, all through our lives, and that's ok, that's good, you've gotta keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be!'<br />

  I didn't know what to say. I didn't know how to say it. I couldn't do anything. My expression pleaded him to stop. I was about to lose him forever and there was nothing I could do. I kept my hand almost touching him, barely maintaining enough willpower to keep a distance at all. He didn't even see what this was doing to me. Loving him didn't matter, because he was going to go. I'd never see him again. But I loved him anyway.</p>
<p>  And right to the end, my eyes never left his face.</p>

<p>True to the series, the end of the eleventh was very emotional. Both the tenth and eleventh doctors have had wise and tragic and emotional endings. It was good... and the quotes... you can't get around the quotes. Smith was more of a <a href="http://sqroot.eu/2012/09/the-new-doctor-the-new-approach/">for-the-kids</a> type of a doctor, but his last moments... let it not be said kids of today can't learn emotion from TV.</p>
<p>The special was great, tied up lots of unanswered questions (and created new ones), brought lots of Who into Christmas (quite literally, Mr. Santa!) and made many weep in sorrow for another fallen man with a big heart. Thank you, Who team, Moffat, Smith, Coleman, Gillan. Raggedy man... goodnight.</p>
