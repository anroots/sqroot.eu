# Week #44 (01 - 04 of May)

We get one final city pass before the Spring Storm. It's Thursday morning and I can not focus on doing anything productive with my last hours of freedom. I get a bagful of fresh apples and other luxury items and return to the barracks.

Lt Mu cancelled the mandatory news watching and gave pvt Mo five laps around the barracks for swearing on the radio.

Our company is the first to go and the last to come from the Spring Storm. That's because our service - communication links - are needed through the exercise and they must always work. We get three days to set it up before the rest of the troops arrive on Monday.

Friday morning sees last preparations: the cars are loaded with fresh water, inspected and made ready to head out. The major gathers everyone to the volleyball field in full battle gear (we squat in a large semicircle) and gives a speech, ordering all to do their best so no-one could say that our battalion couldn't handle the assignments we're responsible for.

As my team is on the reserve, we're among the first to head out. It can be said that I was one of the first to arrive to the exercise in 2014. The drive across Estonia is tireing. 3 hours of monotonous driving. SFC Ps had set the maximum speed limit to 70 (military regulations), but the officers didn't care and pressed it to the max (literally, because it's almost impossible for the old trucks to go faster than 90).

It's interesting to drive in the dark: there's fog and the pavement is composed of loose stones (it's the countryside), I dare not drive faster than 50km/h. The command is already up and operational when we get there and we're allowed to sleep in the officers tents. The ground is dry long hay, it's warm and comfortable.

The first task for the next morning is to fix another teams lousy cabeling work - their version of a air cable (from tree to tree) was two meters from the ground, across a road. Any decent truck could have destroyed it.

The officers let us use their water boilers (extremely useful for coffee and food) and we're allowed to bring our laptops to the tents. Yes, indeed, we were allowed to take laptops to the Spring Storm. Now, before you get your pants in a fret ("Such injustice", I hear the infantry yell), it's because our single task during Spring Storm is to see to it that the radio and cable links are operational. What it means is monitoring server, radio and switch status 24/7. Imagine sitting alone in a 2x3 cell 24*7*3 hours with nothing to do. The laptops are allowed to keep us sane. I use that opportunity to blog and am very content with my current life: spent the evening in a warm sleeping bag with my laptop, drinking hot tea.

The single most important truth I learned through my service is perhaps that nothing is ever certain (in life and in the army). So obviously, when I expected my comfortable life to continue, it did anything but.

I had shut my laptop around 2400 and put it away in a canvas bag, then hit the sack. Around 0200 I'm suddenly awaken by several men, frantically screaming. I sit up, see men moving about and the long, dry grass before my feet burning with open flame. There's smoke everyhwere.

We usually sleep in a circular tent with the oven in the middle, our heads to the outside wall and legs about 40cm from the oven. The officers didn't bother with guarding the fire through the night (and of course we didn't press the issue) and so it happened that the hot coals spilled from below the oven further than expected and lit the grass. Pvt Sk had woken to find his feet on fire (the sleeping bag had melted).

Pvt An grabbed his laptop and went for the door. Someone found the fire extinguisher and used it in four bursts. Instead of the orange light of the fire and the gray of the smoke everything turned white inside the tent. I couldn't see, the bitter white residue of the extinguisher made it difficult if not impossible to breathe. Those who hadn't already exited the tent made for the door. I, being one of the furthest from the entrance didn't bother and in a desperate attempt to find fresh air dived underneath the tent wall and crawled out from there. Srs Hm yelled at me from the door to get out, not yet realizing I was already safe.

I saw the officers exiting their tent in their underwear, quickly getting dressed and relaxing when seeing that everything was under control. We stood there in our underwear, barefoot and laughing in relief at the excitement. The doorway of the tent spilled out a white mix of smoke/fire extinguisher. The tent was breathable five minutes later, although every visible surface was covered with white residue that made the air bitter. My weapon wasn't covered by clothing and got the full blast of the fire extinguisher. I fear I never get it clean. We cleaned up as best as we could. MSG Ls came to take stock as to what was destroyed (one sleeping bag and my bedroll). Pvt Sk was delivered to the infirmary with minor injuries.

I'm glad my laptop was in its protective bag, but from that night onwards, I always took it back to my truck for the night. I'm also proud of my companions (except pvt An) for reacting as they did, especially the officers. Made me realize that when it matters, I can count on them.

------------

Finally, some pleasant work! I am tasked with driving to every NODE team to take them warm breakfast. Pvt An is my navigator, my only job is to drive 150km (4.5h lap) through the sunny countryside. Really, really nice way to spend Spring Storm (I love to drive). It started to drizzle as we got back and of course we, the reserve team, have to head out then, to replace team 13. Luckily, they left their already assembled mast for us. We park the car, set up and I get the first sleeping rotation.

The position is in an open field which belongs to a local farmer. He's a friendly fellow, coming to chat with us about days past and life in the army.

# Week #45 (05 - 11 of May)

Hello, routine. My time passes in a predictable pattern of rotations: patrolling the perimeter, monitoring the communications equipment, sleeping. Many find this - no action, just constant vigilance and monotonous waiting - boring, but I enjoy it very much. Sleeping in our small, but comfortable tent (with heating, mind you) is relaxing. I configured the IT equipment to be as automated as possible, a red box or a changed status line tells me whether I have to do anything, so most of the time on watch duty passes with my laptop (I'm doing various developer things, including programming - and I'm not the only one writing code to escape boredom). Patrol duty is in ways the worst. On daytime, it's more bearable thanks to the sun, but the night is both chilly, scary and boring. I had strategically parked the truck so that the most dangerous attack vectors would be visible from the cabin and yes, I sometimes "cheated" a bit by doing my rounds from the drivers spot. Still, I'm more vigilant than some of the other teams whose idea of a patrol means sleeping.

Pvt Kn came over on the third day with his fuel truck to refuel the generator. I joke that should he manage to get me some fresh apples the next time he comes around, I'll believe that the supply services can get us anything.

A radio link falls down during the night and causes some alarm. We've learned that the commanders are not shy about ordering us to relocate if we can't get our equipment working. The wind is strong and tries to grab hold of our equipment. The delicate civilian tent flaps around wildly, I add extra stakes to it before my sleeping shift. Despite the wind, the tent stays warm. The outside temperature drops to -1 during the night and raises to +10 on daytime. I wear full winter gear while on patrol during the night.

Historic event on the 7th of May: finding out how to do ones business in the woods.

The nights get colder: full winter gear AND my sleeping bag, but I still shiver while standing watch. Yes, I'm a softie.

I get four hours of my morning sleeping shift when the order comes to pack up: pvt Tm's team will replace us. I've developed a strong distaste for him and we yell at each other. I allow my self-control to lapse, because I need to vent and he deserves it.

The camp has developed dramatically since we were last there. There are armed sentrymen, warning signs, barbed wire... We're ID-d and allowed in. The camp is huge, everyone moves around with weapons and looks busy. The atmosphere is very military-like and I totally get some kicks from being a part of that.

We're back in the officers tent, waiting for new orders - which come soon enough. Chores need doing and we spend five hours on various tasks, after which we're allowed to quickly hit the showers before the next deployment. There is an actual shower, built from hoses, wood and plastic. The water is lugged in with trucks and heated over a fire, a compressor pressurizes the system. The water is still cold when we get there, but there's no time to waste and any shower is better than nothing so we get to it (I squel). Twenty minutes later I'm geared up driving out with my team to the next position.

There are problems with the equipment and we spend the whole night working to get it fixed (I'm not kidding, from sundown to sunrise and onwards). I'm dead-tired. In the end, it's a fruitless task and orders come to take the mast down - but alas, no, it won't come down. Two officers come to help, we try every trick, still nothing. Finally, just as we're about to call in the cavilarry, Sgt Ms tries to beat the 35m mast with his foot. Of course that works and the mast lowers without further problems. I think the Russian repair method has some truth to it after all. The officers help us pack, Sgt Ms is in a nice black humor mood and we joke around while working.

We do a quick pass through from the HQ to replace the probably-faulty equipment and head out again. Regulations state that a driver should get at least six hours of uninterupted sleep per 24h, but I'm clocking in 36+hrs already. I have the right to refuse driving, but I don't. Still, I'm extra careful while driving. The new position is a clearing in the middle of a deserted woods and requires careful maneuvering to get in. I'm getting better and better with navigating difficult terrain. The third man from my team didn't come with us (pvt Sk-s leg is still hurting from being on fire, he went to medical), the officers help us settle and set up the equipment. We have no patrol now, but I think we'll be OK - the enemy should be quite far from our position, still. We take shifts of 10 hours, one asleep, the other on monitoring/patrol duty. The only viable spot (smooth ground) for the tent was beneath a half-fallen tree, on an ants nest. The tree looks threatening, but I don't think it falls and squashes me without some major wind. There are some dozens of ants roaming around in the tent, but I pay them little mind and sleep off my 36+h.

I wake restead and cheerful. Why shouldn't I be, there's no patrol rotation and I get to spend my next ten hours in my laptop. I even rig up a feasible internet connection with my phone. Sgt Ms comes and takes over the monitoring duties for two hours while we take his care and drive to the HQ to have a quick shower.

I'm getting more and more content with this life. Two man team, a predictable routine. There are occasional issues such as a switch that malfunctions, a phone call to respond to, reports to file, generator to fuel. I cook a very fancy meal (rice, sauce, jellow, sprite and bread) for myself and spend some time making stakes for the tent: it looks like it's about to rain, I want to tighten up the tent beforehand.

I have time, the internet and laptop. I accept a random web development gig from an aquintance and earn my half-month soldiers "salary" in two hours.

# Week #46 (12 - 18 of May)

It rains heavily, but I dont care. Both the tent and the comms compartment is warm and dry. We're still on 10hrs shifts, either on duty or sleeping. The officers aren't satisfied with some teams and threaten with reprecussions. I'm angry at the others, why must they screw up our good life? Luckily, nothing major happens. Pvt Sk returns, in full health again and we go back to one hour rotations.

We've been on the same spot - a three man team, operating in the middle of the woods, away from civilization - for a week and life is pretty predictable. The clearing we're in has only one access road and it's visible from the car so we don't take patrol duty very seriously - although one man is always on the ready.

Orders come to relocate back to the HQ camp: the reserve forces have finally been mobilized and join the Spring Storm. One team of theirs comes to replace us. They're so slow compared to us! But also more carefree and professional. We pack up, drive back and and go to sleep in the officers tent.

The reserve guys are still bearded and long-haired, but more experienced, disciplined and superior towards us. We do nothing for the whole day, except wash. The unit has twenty minutes, we organize a conveier: everyone undresses, as soon as the next guy comes out from the showers, another goes in. This is some effective and fast washing! The water is hot, this time, there's steam. I'm patrolling in the camp for a few hours during the night.

I wake to the feeling of being thrown with a boot. How rude! Everyone gets their assignments for the day, only my team stays in the camp with two officers. We take shifts patrolling, it's crazyily hot. There's gunfire from about a mile away and I, being the man on duty, run to alert the officers who already exit their tent, gearing up. They might be relaxed and joking while nothing happens but Lt Ve gets really business-like now that there's a threat. The six of us take our positions around the camp and stay on guard for two hours. Luckily, we're not attacked.

We pack up the camp on the following morning and relocate to another, nearby one.

> "Martma! Situb ruttu! Jätkab hiljem!"

We're still the reserve team and hence not officially assigned to anything until there's need for us. The officers advise us not to ask questions or draw attention, just be in our tent, doing whatever. My laptop has been open for a few hours when orders come to head out.

Our route goes through a nearby major population centre and we decide to use the oportunity to visit the local supermarket. The business in the area is booming, both the officers and independant units like mine get their goods from stores.

I drive into the parking lot with my big CE truck only to see the three officers of my company there with a jeep, buying burgers. Oh. Crap! We're so dead... We haven't shaved for god knows how long, are dirty and smell - and no-one gave us express permission to make this pit stop (although no-one specifically denied it, either). But, surprise, surprise, the officers only mockingly greet us (something along the lines of "fancy seeing you here...") and leave us be. We're just about to leave when the military police shows up. I make a quick escape and they don't harass us. I suppose it's viewed as unavoidable that soldiers shop.

Our new task is to provide a comm link to the anti-aircraft division located some ways away from us. We choose a spot atop of a small mountain (again, forested area that's been cleared, there are stumps everywhere and I have to drive carefully). The landscape in Southern Estonia is quite bumpy, if we'd chosen any other spot we would've been in trouble.

A female officer from our customer hikes through the woods alone to greet us. She's pretty, at first I though her to be a fellow service(wo)man.

We have to tow 900m of light cable through thick bushes and woods. It's a miserable ordeal, but we manage - only to fall short 100m from our destination. My partner went to get more cable while I stayed behind to wait. We were so close to the camp that their patrol made their rounds very close from my position. I had forgotten the password to identify myself as friendly and didn't want to get shot so I hid myself under a nearby bush. It was dark enough for my form to be indistinguishable from distance, but the threat of discovery gave me some adrenaline.

We finally managed to complete the cable line and introduce ourselves to the battalion, but surprise-surprise, the cable didn't work. We're miserable and unsure as to what to do. No-one wants to redo the entire line. We wait for orders, the night passes miserably. Just as orders come in to disassemble the line and redo it I try using another port from the switch. Heureka. Life is interesting.

# Week #47 (19 - 25 of May)

The heat and routine activity continues. We're on top of a hill with no escape from the sun, except in the car where the air conditioning can't keep up with the weather.

## A Forest Fire

I'm on patrol duty when I notice smoke rising from 100m ahead, on the side of the hill we're on. I take the smallest fire-extinguisher from the car, alert pvt An and run to investigate. 120m from our position a 6x8 (approximately) section of the hill burns with open flame.

My adrenaline goes up, I empty my small extinguisher on the fire (first time I've ever had to use one), run back to get a bigger one and alert pvt An, ordering him to fetch the last extinguisher from the generator unit. The second spray of CO2 contains the burn somewhat. Pvt An arrives with the last extinguisher, having notified the command of the situation. I head back to wake the sleeping shift and to fetch the water canister. The phone rings, I give more details to our CO. We douse the flames with water, stomping and a shovel.

Help from a nearby friendly unit arrives four minutes later: dozens of uniformed men, having gotten the call of our CO and ran a kilometer towards us to help, a truck loaded with canisters of water following shortly after. This was an inspiring sight, privates and officers (up to the rank of a Major) running to aid us, the Major taking command and starting to organize the cleanup. We had managed to extinguish the open flames before they got to us, but the dry ground was still smoking ominously and even burst into flames again.

I explain the situation to them and to the military police who arrives some time later along with a fire crew who had to be guided in for we were in a secluded, forested area. The MP-s collect some information from me and are dubious as to the nature of the fire, but settle on it being a self-combustion case due to the hot weather. The firemen douse the are with water and we are allowed to continue with our assignments.

------------------

The excitement of that day was not over yet. Around midnight, a thunderstorm rolled in. I wake from my shift of sleep and squat in the tent, warm and protected from the weather as heavy raindrops pummel against the tent and flashes of lightning illuminate the landscape. And we, the radio unit, have a big, big lightning pole on top of a hill, next to the car in the form of a high antenna.

I can't go back to sleep again and end my shift early. Ironically, we still have the internet: although we disconnected from the radio antenna as a lightning precaution, we're still connected via the comms cable we set up a day earlier. So we sit in the dry and warm car, following the storms movement via [lightningmaps.org](http://www.lightningmaps.org/realtime?lang=en) (live storm tracking). Finally, the storm moves over us and we resume our duties.




We abandon our position at 0800 the following day. We roll up the kilometer of cable, pack up and head meet up with a nearby

Kell 08 hüpe. Allemaniga valguskaablit kokku kerima. Pakime maja kokku, sõidame õhutõrje laagrisse. Ootame 2-3h kuni nad oma asju kokku pakivad, nad nõudsid, et sõidaksime 5km uuele positsioonile nende kolonnis, ees kohale sõita ei lubatud sest "peame julgestatult liikuma".
Uus positsioon lageraie, pehme pinnas. Jään 30m teest eemal kinni, auto vajus sisse. Kutsume puksiiri, läheb aega, sest JuPu laagrit rünnati ja nad tapeti ära. Loos proovib unimogiga välja tõmmata, kaevab unimogi ka sisse. Toovad recovery, tõmbavad trossiga esmalt mogi, siis mind. Ühendame käru lahti, et see enne tõmmata, käru kukub tahapoole maha, tiisel üles. Lõpuks saab välja, 2h, sügavad rööpad. Paneme 150m eemale kenale heinamaale, parim positsioon üldse. AllemanSikk valgust vedama, 1800m, kolm rulli, RÕK toob öösel lisarulli. Sajab vihma, eemal äike, vihmakeebid, õnnetu. Panen üksinda masina paika, vaiad, masti, telgi valmis. Kerime öösel üles, jalad lirtsuvad. Saame püsti, Sikk magama, side ühe panniga töötab, valgus ka. Teine ei tööta, Weber möliseb, et tal kõik õige, hiljem ärkab Jäms, ütleb, et MH kaabel oli lahti, tõmbame paar tiiru nookurit ja side olemas. On lammas. Kuivad sokid + varusaapad on SOOJAD võrreldes lirtsuvatega, nii mõnus. Panen saapad geneka peale kuivama, selle jahutus kuivatab ära. Jälle 36h magamata, üritan kõigest jõust 05..06 ajal ärkevl olla, aga korraks viskab intervallidega pildi tasku. Füüsiline liikumine aitab. Isegi arvuti ei aita ülal olla. Hommikusöök, siis kell 9 magama 7h. Mõnus.

21

Keegi pole huiamas käinud, vahepeal oli kõva vihm, kuid telgis kuiv ja soe. Päike tuli välja. Läpakas kahekesi kongis, viimane päev, ei huvita väga. Homme sõidame tagasi, kuna oleme mina sikk ja alleman, siis teeme nii, et autojuhid magavad kahekesi telgis, alleman on üksinda. Tegelikult väga ei tohiks, aga ei huvita.

22

Äratus, 7h magada. Ootame käsku kokku pakkida. Kerin 1800m valguskaablit kokku, liin läks läbi reaalse võsa, pidi kätega teed murdma. Selle peale läks paar tundi, kolm pooli. Peale seda kohe mast alla. Keegi kohalik tuli uudistama väikese tütrega, ütles, et nägid, et mast hakkas allapoole liikuma. Panin muusikat. Käisime külapoest läbi. RÕK laagris, liigume esimese kolonniga tagasi. Nellis ütleb, et 70, ise sõidab 90-ga. Vahepeal oli 30 ala, teised autojuhid vannuvad üksmeelselt et miks ma neljakümnega ainult sõitsin. Peatusime scout pazi kolonni kõrval 40km tallinnast. Esimese asjana autosid pesema. Mardu tuleb türa mölisema. Järsku on liikluskorraldus muutunud?! Kes andis käsu pesta? Pargin ära, ei viitsi temaga möliseda, dick will be dick, 7p veel. Pesema ei jõudnud, sest Mardu nah. Kell 5 äratab Tamtam, ikka saab autosid pesta, pesen 1h.
23
Paas ütleb, et mu auto jumala must. On ka. Alt. Peseme kella 12-ni, mõlemad pesulad meie, siis on stabai kord. Teisedteevad konge. Auto alt on väga palju teha, nagu relv. Saukas käib näitamas kust pesta, Paas ainult ütleb, et ei ole puhas, peske veel. Põrgu. Arvan, et sain enda oma 2h-ga puhtaks. Teised magavad, ma veel pargin ja laadin varustust tagasi peale. Öösel üksinda pesema

Srs Ott staabikaitse rivi ees: Staabikaitse rühmale reservi puhul kolm korda elagu!

Ivannikov tagala rivi ees: Asp Martma õele kolm korda elagu!

Kõik naeravad.
24
Isikliku varustuse hooldus. Relva hooldus 2h. Suruõhuga. Räägin Tgagalaga juttu.Mini majanduspäev. Tiideman manitseb, et kainena naaseksime. Teen kapi isiklikest asjadest tühjaks, sh läpakas. Viin pesu koju, et KV varustus pesta. X men. Üks purk siidrit, kohe vintis, pole kaua saanud.
25

Autode pesemine, konserveerimine. Pesin üht 1017-t terve päeva, iga kord peale ettenäitamist leiti veel puuduseid. Auto all on väga palju kohti mis võivad mustad olla. Auto on nagu relv.

# Week #48 (26 - 31 of May)

26

Autode pesemine, konserveerimine. Sõitsin autosid kütusevahetuseks. Teeme staabi autosid, kuna meie omad on juba valmis. Mehed pakivad asju.

27

Pealelõunat õhtuni relva nühkimine. Kõikvõimalikest kohtadest puhtaks, seersandid kontrollisid kõiki juppe ükshaaval, oli teada, et homseks peab olema puhas ja kaader tuleb kontrollima. Kui viimasel oli puhas, võis magama minna.

28

Hommikul esimese asjana relvade üleandmine. Viimased relvanühkimised, kõikide relvad toolidega kompanii peal ja juppideks. Kogu SiKo kaader lendas relvalappidega peale, kui sobis, võis kokku panna. Minuga jäädi esimesel korral rahule - thats a first.

Esimene asjade äraandmine. Pakkisime asjad nimekirja alusel seljakotti ja torukotti. Seljakotti said rakmed, torukotti riided. Kõik kompanii peale, näitasime ükshaaval varustusesemed ette, viisime kotid reservivarustuse konteinerisse. Iga kott on komplektne varustus, tulevad mehed sõtta, haaravad kaks kotti ja valmis.

29

Hommikul äratus 0600. Martma tuleb tsiviilriietes tuppa ja mängib telefonist fanfaari. Käsk kohe tsiviilid selga panna. Võtan kapist teksad, viisaka kampsuni, vorm kappi. Alustan viimaste asjade seljakotti pakkimist. Sajab vihma, on 7kraadi sooja. Paljud on võtnud ainult T-särgi, lühikesed püksid arvates, et on 30kraadi ja päike nagu paar päeva tagasi. Käime pääsla teed harjaga küürimas, külm on, kardan haigestuda. Hommikusöök tsiviilides ümber maja. Varustuse tagastamine erivarustuse lattu 10min. Ootame päris pikalt tubades, loen raamatut. Mingit erilist põnevust ei ole, pigem väike kärsitus. Kasearu kogub autojuhtide ringkäigu paberid ja võtab kõik allkirjad peale meditsiini, seda käin ise võtmas. Pärnpuu annab klassis kogu SiKo kaadrile potilille nimesiltidega üle. Kaader naljatleb, et tuleb kastmistoimkond. Otsustan jätta blogi väljaprindi kompanii lauda, lisan kiire teate uutele: 29 reserv, jõudu. Lasteaed käib ekskursioonil, ka jaoülemate toas, mille põrand on normaalselt segamini ja asju täis. Voodipesu kogutakse. Kaljula annab tänukirja luulekonkursi eest. Vangla käib narkokoeri treenimas, mehed rivvi, peidetakse reameestele narkot, koer otsib. Päris hirmus, kui hambad kubet nuusutamas käivad. Keegi väga sihilikult ei nussigi. Viimane lõuna. Rivistus, pat ülem räägib viimased sõnad, viimased ergutused peamiselt TeKole ja seersantidele. SiKo ülemad võtavad veel sõna, siis vabalt rivitult ja reservi. Val juurde, impro. Üks mees tuli kildiga.

Pärnpuu: "Rühm, VALVEL! Kasarmu ringselt söökla ette TAKTSAMMU MARSS!"

- Rivist: "Nendes riietes ei tehta taktsammu!"

-Mets, naerdes "Ei virise, läheb taktsammu"

"Rühm, VALVEL! Seersant Pärnpuu, viige üksus reservi ära" - Naaris?
