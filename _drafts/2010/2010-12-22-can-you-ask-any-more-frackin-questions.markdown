<p>I recently started rewatching&nbsp;my favourite moments of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094580/" rel="imdb" title="Whose Line Is It Anyway?">Whose Line is it Anyway</a>, an improv comedy show hosted by <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.myspace.com/everything/drew-carey" rel="myspaceeverything" title="Drew Carey">Drew Carey</a>.</p>
<p>One of the games was titled &quot;questions only&quot; in which the &quot;contestants&quot; tried to outwit each other with questions that would force the opponent to answer with a sentence. The original video can be seen below.</p>
<p>After &quot;Like&quot;-ing the video in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> I got a comment from a good friend, which, strangely enough, was in a form of a question.</p>
<p>Unable to resist the temptation, I responded. What ensued can only be described as a battle of wits, spanning several months.</p>
<p>The transcript can be seen below (Note that neither of us has given in yet so the transcript keeps on growing. It&#039;s currently 250 entries long and published with the participant&#039;s permission.). On a related note, our university <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" rel="wikipedia" title="English language">English</a> course had a section dedicated to asking questions and I tried to incorporate the tactics and tips learned there as best I could.&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Carolys: Should I always answer a question with a question x)?
16 November at 19:14
Ando Roots: Shouldn&#039;t you?
16 November at 19:31
Carolys: Should I?
16 November at 19:33
Ando Roots: Do You think that I know the answer to that...?
16 November at 19:44
Carolys: You don&#039;t :o :o???
16 November at 19:46
Ando Roots: Do you think I&#039;m all-knowing?
16 November at 19:47
Carolys: Do you think I&#039;m not?
16 November at 19:48
Ando Roots: Why do you need advice then?
16 November at 19:51
Carolys: Shouldn&#039;t people ask for advice when they&#039;re confused?
16 November at 19:54
Ando Roots: Am I confusing You?
16 November at 19:54
Carolys: Are you feeling confused?
16 November at 20:00
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t You know that there&#039;s no shame in admitting defeat?
16 November at 20:03
Carolys: Do you know why winning feels good?
16 November at 20:05
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t You know that they used to call me &#039;The Unbeatable One&#039;?
16 November at 20:09
Carolys: Don&#039;t you know that people start avoiding me for a reason?
06 December at 22:50
Ando Roots: What reason would that be?
06 December at 23:10
Carolys: By telling you now I would ruin all the fun, wouldn&#039;t I?
07 December at 00:02
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think that talking about it could help?
07 December at 00:59
Carolys: Do you think talking about this in FB is safe and won&#039;t bite me in the a** later?
07 December at 01:05
Ando Roots: Are you finally realizing the threat social networks pose to privacy?
07 December at 01:42
Carolys: Are you finally realizing that I understand the risks, but am refusing to run away scared?
07 December at 02:01
Ando Roots: Are you implying that I&#039;m a coward?
07 December at 07:44
Carolys: Are you implying that I&#039;m stupid?
07 December at 08:31
Ando Roots: Can&#039;t we just be friends again?
07 December at 10:22
Carolys: Aren&#039;t we just having a little harmless fun =)?
07 December at 10:23
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think it went too far?
07 December at 10:25
Carolys: Do you really expect me to answer that?
07 December at 10:58
Ando Roots: Can you resist my questioning?
07 December at 15:34
Carolys: Can&#039;t you stop yourself?
08 December at 15:51
Ando Roots: &lrm;...from doing what?
08 December at 22:45
Carolys: Do you even notice, what you just did?
08 December at 22:46
Ando Roots: Care to enlighten me?
09 December at 00:40
Carolys: Wouldn&#039;t it be easier if you just read over what you have written?
09 December at 00:43
Ando Roots: Shouldn&#039;t you be more worried about the impending English essay deadline then my ignorance ?
09 December at 00:44
Carolys: Worrying would give me wrinkles, wouldn&#039;t it?
09 December at 02:04
Ando Roots: Aren&#039;t wrinkles the sign of wisdom?
09 December at 08:48
Carolys: Aren&#039;t wrinkles and wisdom more oftenly used to describe old age?
09 December at 16:10
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t it more important to be beautiful inside?
09 December at 16:33
Carolys: Doesn&#039;t the world only care about the exterior?
09 December at 16:56
Ando Roots: Do you really care what people like P. Anderson consider &#039;pretty&#039; ?
09 December at 16:59
Carolys: How did poor Pamela get in your way?
09 December at 17:03
Ando Roots: Is it your dream to be &#039;pretty&#039;, rich, famous and brainless?
09 December at 17:04
Carolys: Since when you think so less of me?
09 December at 17:19
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you see it&#039;s reverse-psychology and rhetorics I&#039;m using?
09 December at 17:21
Carolys: Can&#039;t you see that I&#039;m just trying to trap you too?
09 December at 17:23
Ando Roots: Why on earth would you be so mean?
09 December at 17:29
Carolys: Why are you talking in riddles?
09 December at 17:48
Ando Roots: Is there a better way to make someone really think?
09 December at 21:57
Carolys: I think that saying what you really mean without mysteries is better, don&#039;t you?
09 December at 22:25
Ando Roots: Do you see many people express their true feeling nowadays?
09 December at 22:34
Carolys: And that&#039;s a negative thing, isn&#039;t it?
09 December at 22:36
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think that some things, good or bad, are better left unsaid?
09 December at 22:45
Carolys: Do you really believe that silence helps to make the world a better place?
09 December at 22:47
Ando Roots: &lrm;...and in Your mind, is it better to be blunt and have no private thoughts?
09 December at 22:55
Carolys: You can go straight to the point without involving emotions, can&#039;t you?
09 December at 22:59
Ando Roots: Didn&#039;t You learn anything from Equilibrium?
09 December at 23:10
Carolys: Do you think sci-fi movies are good for describing the real world?
09 December at 23:31
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you see that one can learn much from these situations, no matter if fictional or not?
10 December at 00:24
Carolys: Have you lost your ability to differenciate between fiction and reality?
10 December at 00:33 &middot; Unlike &middot;  1 person
Ando Roots: Would you believe that I&#039;ve lived in my own world for more than a decade now?
10 December at 00:46
Carolys: Doesn&#039;t that make you feel a bit left out?
10 December at 00:48
Ando Roots: Why do you think I&#039;m so grumpy?
10 December at 01:02
Carolys: Are you like Bashful then?
10 December at 16:53
Ando Roots: What do you think?
10 December at 18:11
Carolys: The real question is, what do you?
10 December at 18:47
Ando Roots: Why are you asking so many questions?
10 December at 18:52
Carolys: Why aren&#039;t you answering any?
10 December at 18:56
Ando Roots: Would you like to see Your offhand comments in tomorrow&#039;s editions of the yellow media?
10 December at 18:59
Carolys: What on earth might you be talking about?
10 December at 19:32
Ando Roots: Et vous?
10 December at 20:09
Carolys: As in high quality ladieswear brand?
10 December at 20:30
Ando Roots: Come again?
10 December at 21:25
Carolys: French quote?
10 December at 21:58
Ando Roots: Wasn&#039;t it obvious?
10 December at 22:30
Carolys: You think you&#039;re so smart?
10 December at 22:32
Ando Roots: Are You still under the opinion that You can beat me?
10 December at 22:36
Carolys: Are you still delusional about me falling into one of your little traps?
10 December at 22:38
Ando Roots: Wouldn&#039;t it be worth it through?
10 December at 22:44
Carolys: When is failing ever worth something?
10 December at 22:47
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t we learn from experience?
10 December at 22:54
Carolys: We do, really?
10 December at 23:21
Ando Roots: Was that almost a question?
10 December at 23:44
Carolys: Are you questioning my questions?
11 December at 00:02
Ando Roots: Surely You must see that it was a questionable question?
11 December at 01:12
Carolys: What if I don&#039;t?
11 December at 01:18
Ando Roots: Was that a threat?
11 December at 01:25
Carolys: Have you ever been truly threatened?
11 December at 01:39
Ando Roots: Are you doing it now?
11 December at 01:54
Carolys: Are you implying that I have the power to threaten you?
11 December at 12:56
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t it a fact that the pen is mightier than the sword?
11 December at 15:05
Carolys: There is a big difference between getting stabbed with a pen or with a sword, don&#039;t you think?
11 December at 15:17
Ando Roots: Do you know that a stab wound made by a pen is quite hard to diagnose (that is, one could just be drunk) and is therefore more dangerous than a big bleeding sword cut?
11 December at 15:34
Carolys: Care to elaborate on your idea?
11 December at 17:41
Ando Roots: Which idea would that be?
11 December at 17:55
Carolys: Are you saying that you didn&#039;t provide me an idea?
11 December at 18:24
Ando Roots: Did I?
11 December at 18:32
Carolys: Could you?
11 December at 18:35
Ando Roots: Do what?
11 December at 18:37
Carolys: Why are you pretending to be clueless?
11 December at 18:39
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t it what people with a mild version of ADD do?
11 December at 18:41
Carolys: Do you think that is an excuse?
11 December at 19:17
Ando Roots: What&#039;s the matter with you?
11 December at 19:18
Carolys: But what&#039;s wrong with you?
12 December at 04:49
Ando Roots: How can you be up at 5 in the morning?
12 December at 10:05
Carolys: The real question is, how can you be up at eleven, when I was supposed to wake up?
12 December at 13:50
Ando Roots: Why didn&#039;t you?
12 December at 14:44
Carolys: Why do people in general sleep in?
12 December at 23:07
Ando Roots: &lrm;...they were otherwise engaged and sleeping didn&#039;t take precedence until later?
12 December at 23:58
Carolys: But why can&#039;t people just wake up when their alarmclock starts to buzz?
13 December at 00:27
Ando Roots: You had to leave it within your grasp, didn&#039;t you?
13 December at 00:36
Carolys: You really have just one :o?
13 December at 00:44
Ando Roots: What do you mean?
13 December at 01:16
Carolys: Do you have just one ringing one to help you wake up in the morning?
13 December at 01:17
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t one enough?
13 December at 01:18
Carolys: Whenever is one enough?
13 December at 01:21
Ando Roots: What would it take to wake you on time?
13 December at 10:44
Carolys: Why do you ask - have you gotten the expression that I am a lousy morning person?
13 December at 17:18
Ando Roots: Wouldn&#039;t you want to change your bad ways?
13 December at 17:28
Carolys: Have you ever considered not breathing for a while?
13 December at 18:02
Ando Roots: What are you suggesting?
13 December at 18:06
Carolys: Can&#039;t you read between the lines?
13 December at 18:14
Ando Roots: I&#039;m a waste of space, aren&#039;t I...
13 December at 18:39
Carolys: Are you feeling down today?
13 December at 19:04
Ando Roots: How can you tell?
13 December at 19:31
Carolys: Women are more intuitive towards sensing moods, aren&#039;t we?
13 December at 19:42 &middot; Unlike &middot;  1 person
Ando Roots: Was that almost a question?
13 December at 20:28
Carolys: Does being mean come naturally to you?
13 December at 20:29
Ando Roots: Would you help me become a better man?
13 December at 20:36
Carolys: Are you saying that you&#039;re bad or just that there is room for improvement?
13 December at 21:06
Ando Roots: Was that a no?
13 December at 21:40
Carolys: Are you avoiding my question?
13 December at 21:46
Ando Roots: Would you believe that there&#039;s no good answer to it?
13 December at 21:54
Carolys: You wouldn&#039;t believe me if I said there was?
13 December at 22:02
Ando Roots: You aren&#039;t going to tell me, are you?
13 December at 22:45
Carolys: You wouldn&#039;t let me get off the topic so easily, now would you?
13 December at 22:55
Ando Roots: What if I would?
13 December at 23:14
Carolys: Have you gone soft?
13 December at 23:15
Ando Roots: Care to elaborate on that?
13 December at 23:17
Carolys: I believe you might be throwing in the towel, am I correct?
13 December at 23:22
Ando Roots: What do you mean?
13 December at 23:23
Carolys: You really don&#039;t seem to like English idioms, do you?
13 December at 23:27
Ando Roots: How am I supposed to know them if I had no-one to practice them with?
13 December at 23:31
Carolys: But to practice them you should have to know them first, don&#039;t you agree?
13 December at 23:33
Ando Roots: Should I just pick up a idioms book and start learning them?
13 December at 23:35
Carolys: Don&#039;t you think there are many idioms in normal books as well?
13 December at 23:59
Ando Roots: Would it interest you that I don&#039;t read normal books?
14 December at 00:06
Carolys: But you do read books?
14 December at 00:09
Ando Roots: How could anyone live without them?
14 December at 00:10
Carolys: How can you possibly claim that the books you read don&#039;t use idioms and interesting phrases?
14 December at 00:11
Ando Roots: When did you hear me claim that?
14 December at 00:12
Carolys: Should I apologize?
14 December at 00:19
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think it&#039;s too late?
14 December at 00:21
Carolys: Don&#039;t you know it&#039;s impolite to reject a sincere apology?
14 December at 00:23
Ando Roots: Why are you so offensive?
14 December at 00:26
Carolys: Could it be because of the same reason why you&#039;re so defensive?
14 December at 00:32
Ando Roots: Aren&#039;t we going on circles here?
14 December at 07:24
Carolys: Do you really thinkt that&#039;s what we are doing here?
14 December at 09:12
Ando Roots: Are you mocking me?!
14 December at 09:12
Carolys: Are you dissing me?
14 December at 12:07
Ando Roots: Am I what you?
14 December at 13:55
Carolys: Writing FB comments in English class, really doesn&#039;t suit you, does it?
14 December at 20:05
Ando Roots: Is English Your favourite subject that you&#039;re defending?
14 December at 22:53
Carolys: Must one favourite just one subject?
14 December at 23:00
Ando Roots: Couldn&#039;t you be less philosophical?
14 December at 23:01
Carolys: Does it really bother you?
15 December at 00:11
Ando Roots: Shouldn&#039;t it annoy any student of Applied Sciences?
15 December at 00:56
Carolys: Are you saying that I am annoying you?
16 December at 11:54
Ando Roots: Why are you so negative?
16 December at 13:42
Carolys: Seriously, are you trying to convince me that you are the positive one?
16 December at 20:27
Ando Roots: Can you prove me wrong?
16 December at 23:22
Carolys: Doesn&#039;t the IT-student stereotype indicate that you pout a lot?
17 December at 00:13
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t a pout the funniest expression in the world?
17 December at 00:14
Carolys: Why do you think that?
17 December at 00:16
Ando Roots: Do you know of something more spontaneous and funny?
17 December at 00:20
Carolys: Do you allow me to stop you right there and tell you something funny?
17 December at 01:43
Ando Roots: Do I have a choice?
17 December at 02:18
Carolys: Have you ever heard of ROTFLSHMSFOAIDMT?
17 December at 02:28
Ando Roots: What does that stand for?
17 December at 02:33
Carolys: Are you sure you don&#039;t want to try and guess?
17 December at 02:47
Ando Roots: Would you make fun of me if I did?
17 December at 03:09
Carolys: Who am I to laugh at others&#039; failures?
17 December at 03:18
Ando Roots: Does it have something to do with cucumbers and hippopotamuses?
17 December at 07:42
Carolys: Doesn&#039;t everything?
17 December at 16:50
Ando Roots: What have you been smoking?
17 December at 19:03
Carolys: I thought that you were the one who has been acting funny recently?
17 December at 20:16
Ando Roots: Was I acting ... not funny... before?
17 December at 22:37
Carolys: What might you been drinking 8-)?
17 December at 23:02
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think that red wine is the noblest of alcoholic beverages?
17 December at 23:19
Carolys: Would you hate me if I said no?
17 December at 23:21
Ando Roots: Why do you think so?
17 December at 23:22
Carolys: You always say mean things when I like different things then you, don&#039;t you?
18 December at 00:06
Ando Roots: When have I done that?
18 December at 00:11
Carolys: Are you telling me that you don&#039;t even remember?
18 December at 01:52
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think that it&#039;s because that hasn&#039;t happened?
18 December at 13:35
Carolys: Maybe you are just forgetful in your old age?
18 December at 17:42
Ando Roots: &lrm;...how should I respond to that?
18 December at 17:50
Carolys: Shouldn&#039;t you just say what you&#039;re feeling?
18 December at 19:17
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think that sometimes it&#039;s better to keep quiet instead?
Sunday at 00:03
Carolys: But before you were saying that people should express their emotions, weren&#039;t you?
Sunday at 00:04
Ando Roots: Was I really?
Sunday at 00:07
Carolys: Are you implaying that I can&#039;t read?
Monday at 00:31
Ando Roots: Could I persuade you to sing in a christmas carol?
Monday at 17:12
Carolys: Do you have any ideas how to make me do something as drastic as that?
Monday at 20:25 &middot; Unlike &middot;  1 person
Ando Roots: Would bribing you with something tasty work?
Monday at 20:25
Carolys: Do you really think all people can be manipulated into doing something they don&#039;t want to do?
Monday at 20:27
Ando Roots: What&#039;s so bad in singing a peaceful, slightly sad song with group of friends for the enjoyment of random strangers?
Monday at 20:31
Carolys: Not all people can sing, you know? (Do you know that at least one of us doesn&#039;t have her/his voice at the moment?)
Monday at 20:58
Ando Roots: Are you saying you can&#039;t hum or play an instrument either?
Monday at 21:09
Carolys: Would agreeing with you now, make ma loser?
Monday at 21:20
Ando Roots: What are you suggesting?
Monday at 21:43
Carolys: What aren&#039;t you telling me?
Monday at 21:48

<p><strong>Update: I admit it. I gave up. The last bit went like this:</strong></p>
<pre>Carolys: We haven&#039;t learned anything about assuming things without evidence, have we?

Ando Roots: Where do you think hypothesis come from?
23 December at 02:49 
Carolys: Care to remind me in your own words what hypothesis?
23 December at 02:51 
Ando Roots: Can&#039;t you name some yourself?
23 December at 02:54 
Carolys: Didn&#039;t I ask you first?
23 December at 02:57 
Ando Roots: Didn&#039;t you hear me call dibs?
23 December at 03:11 
Carolys: When might you have said an awful thing like that :o?
23 December at 03:14 
Ando Roots: How good is your short term memory?
23 December at 03:17 
Carolys: How good is your long term memory?
23 December at 03:26 
Ando Roots: Would you believe I remember the Big Bang?
23 December at 03:32 
Carolys: How sleep-deprived are you?
23 December at 03:44 
Ando Roots: Shouldn&#039;t you know?
23 December at 03:50 
Carolys: I&#039;m not responsible for your sleep deprivation, am I?
23 December at 13:43 
Ando Roots: Should I deny it?
23 December at 21:19 
Carolys: That would be nice, wouldn&#039;t it?
23 December at 21:20 
Ando Roots: Will you accept my denials then?
23 December at 22:49 
Carolys: What are you in denial about?
23 December at 22:51 
Ando Roots: Don&#039;t you think I want an answer to that question too?
23 December at 22:57 
Carolys: Are you saying that you are not interested in life&#039;s mysteries?
23 December at 23:50 
Ando Roots: What exactly do you mean?
23 December at 23:54 
Carolys: Don&#039;t you find yourself thinking what all of this means?
23 December at 23:57 
Ando Roots: What&#039;s the meaning of Life?
24 December at 00:07 
Carolys: Be honest, haven&#039;t thought about that question for a while, have you?
24 December at 00:16 
Ando Roots: Haven&#039;t you ever found yourself pondering the same question?
24 December at 00:26 
Carolys: And what about those aliens?
24 December at 00:27 
Ando Roots: Do alien beings exist in the infinite, ever expanding universe or are we, humans, unique?
24 December at 00:31 
Carolys: So you believe that humans aren&#039;t the only intelligent lifeform in the universe?
24 December at 00:37 
Ando Roots: From a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, the universe could be seen as a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff, wouldn&#039;t you agree?
24 December at 00:41 
Carolys: An objective viewpoint uses verbs like wibbly wobbly, then objectiveness is screwed, wouldn&#039;t you say?
24 December at 00:58 
Ando Roots: What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis?
24 December at 01:05 
Carolys: Is this math-related anyhow?
24 December at 01:06 
Ando Roots: Isn&#039;t everything?
24 December at 01:20 
Carolys: So you are not going to tell me what you meant, are you?
24 December at 01:25 
Ando Roots: What would you be willing to do to get my explanation?
24 December at 01:30 
Carolys: Asking you nicely isn&#039;t enough =(?
24 December at 01:30 
Ando Roots: Can&#039;t you think of any alternatives?
24 December at 01:34 
Carolys: Is asking you with a slight hint of violence better?
24 December at 01:36 
Ando Roots: Can&#039;t do any violence here, can you?
24 December at 01:37 
Carolys: I can&#039;t send you viruses, could I?
24 December at 01:40 
Ando Roots: Are you really agreeing to what I just said?
24 December at 01:43 
Carolys: Have you gone blind?
Saturday at 17:43 
Ando Roots: Would you think differently of me if I have?
Saturday at 19:40 
Carolys: Have you noticed how many times you have asked me the same question?
Saturday at 19:41 
Ando Roots: Have you noticed how many times you have evaded from answering?
Saturday at 19:45 
Carolys: You must take into consideration how many questions you have left unanswered as well, mustn&#039;t you?
Saturday at 19:46 
Ando Roots: Why do you ask questions that can&#039;t easily be answered?
Saturday at 19:50 
Carolys: Would you prefer easy, yes or no, questions?
Saturday at 19:54 
Ando Roots: Is there ever such a thing as an easy question that&#039;s coming from you?
Saturday at 20:04 
Carolys: Are you saying that I like complicating matters for my own personal amusement?
Saturday at 20:09 
Ando Roots: Yes.
Saturday at 20:24 
Carolys: Seriously, how could you just give up like that? =(
