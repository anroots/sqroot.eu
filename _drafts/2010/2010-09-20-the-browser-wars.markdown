<div><em>This article was part of my English assignment. The goal was to use as many &quot;in, on and at phrases&quot; as possible.</em></div>

<p>As with many other real-world corporations, there is a fierce competition between Web browser makers like Microsoft and Mozilla. In principle, a Web browser is a piece of software that enables the user to browse the World Wide Web. And since we spend more and more time online, there&rsquo;s a growing market to be fought over.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the competition is good, because it forces designers to be more innovative and outwit the competitors. On the other hand, there is more confusion to the average user, who, in most cases, may not even know what a browser is.</p>
<p>In some respects, I feel the publicity around the user&rsquo;s choice is sufficient. In general, the end-user doesn&rsquo;t care who made the browser as long as (s)he can do most of the basic tasks that a web browser should be able to do. In other words, the war is fought for the undecided users, in particular the lower-educated ones. In other words, the browser war is like politics &ndash; companies point to figures and claim that their product is the best one available, but it&rsquo;s up to the user to get the facts and choose a favourite.</p>
