<p style="text-align: justify">This post marks the end of my 3rd semester in the <a href="http://itcollege.ee">best IT university in Estonia</a>. The subject? Programming in C#. The exam? Awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What ever do I mean? How could an exam be anything but excruciating? Let me explain by telling you why I became (<a href="http://sqroot.eu/2011/09/be-a-developer-not-a-programmer/">more precicely, want to become</a>) a developer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Development is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">creative</span> field and as with any other similar subject - be it painting, composing or even cooking - offers a certain amount of satisfaction, both during and after a problem is tackled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It took me a while to figure this out. Skip back half a decade to my high-school years. I kept putting off studying Russian in favour of solving math problems by writing algorithms (the odd thing was that I wasn't  really fond of math during the time). Thinking back, it's obvious why I did it. The process of problem-solving was far more interesting and rewarding than all those pesky (<em>useless</em>) grammar rules or even the end result, the algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Passion, of course, changes everything: dull problems become exciting and the goal changes from the big finish to the journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.”<br />
Greg Anderson</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">I guess what I'm trying to say is that coding is never dull when done by passionate people... and so, neither is an exam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The source code for my assignment can be seen <a href="https://github.com/anroots/ITK-projects/tree/master/C%23/Eksam/">over @ GitHub</a> (with the instructors permission). The solution was praised and graded 100%.</p>
