<p style="text-align: justify">I ran across "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzRlcnq_c0&amp;feature=g-like&amp;context=G2a17e4aALT3OCBgABAA">Poison and Wine</a>" by <a href="http://thecivilwars.com/about.php">The Civil Wars</a> yesterday in a YouTube playlist and instantly knew I'd found the song that'll haunt me for the rest of the week (if not longer). Such intense emotions and spirit, not the mention the meaning behind the words.

<p style="text-align: justify">Anyhow, the song is an inspiring one and below are alternate lyrics, composed by yours truly... that convey a slightly different message.

<h3>Alternative lyrics to "Poison And Wine" by The Civil Wars</h3>
<pre>[John]: The saddest part you don't even know
[Joy]: What used to be is gone somehow
[John]: I don't see you, you don't see me
[Joy]: I keep wishing we could just be

Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
How can I tell?

[Joy]: I wish you'd come and hug me tight
[John]: Why must it always be fight or flight?
[Joy]: Oh, your love could save me, you could be mine
[John]: Why do you fear of what's been always thine?

Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?

Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
Oh, do you love me, how can I tell?
How can I tell?

How can I tell?
How can I tell?
How can I tell?
How can I tell?</pre>
