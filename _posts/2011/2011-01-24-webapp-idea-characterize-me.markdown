Inspired by [threewords.me](http://threewords.me), I thought it would be a good idea to push the thought a bit further.

The website should look Web 2.0-ish, with a clear and big GUI, AJAX and simple eye-candy. The website let&#039;s the user to setup a page where people with the link are presented with a list (grid) of checkboxes with different adjectives (some pre-defined, users can add more to the database). These visitors pick adjectives that, in their opinion, best describe the user whose page they are currently viewing.

The user can later see a summary of the results and optionally publish it.

Keywords:

* Integration with Facebook and Twitter
* Clean and simple
* Minimal page refreshes
* Minimal time setting up
* Modern web technologies
* Pretty GUI
