A picture says more than a thousand words... (Don&#039;t believe that? Try describing [this picture of Katersoneseven](http://twitpic.com/3l5v46) accurately, relaying every detail).

I was recently chastised for not using any/not enough emoticons in my MSN conversations. Indeed, smileys help to relay the current mood much better than words and so I borrowed some (Pidgin&#039;s default ones aren&#039;t really pretty) from my friend and made myself use them.

Anyway, today I didn&#039;t really feel like typing and thought that I could express my opinion with only emoticons. This is what happened, I actually laughed out loud.
