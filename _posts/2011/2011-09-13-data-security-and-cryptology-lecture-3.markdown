<h3>Safeguards</h3>
<div>Safeguards can be divided into 3 classes:</div>
<ol>
<li>Preventive safeguards - Prevent security incidents from happening. The main line of defense.
<ul>
<li>
<div>- Minimize vulnerabilities and risk probabilities</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>- Prevent attacks</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>- Decrease the ripple effects of a security incident to other IT assets<br />
					&nbsp;</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identifying safeguards - Tell us that a security incident has occurred so we can take suitable action.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reconstructive safeguards - We need to restore the environment before the security incident occurred. For example, if the firewall was disabled, it needs to be re-enabled ASAP. The more important the object, the more attention should be given to reconstructive safeguards.&nbsp;Methods:
<ul>
<li>- Backup</li>
<li>- Renovation</li>
<li>- Replacement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Identifying safeguards</h3>
<div>Goals:</div>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding the incident</li>
<li>Identify the incident&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>- Operative Identification: If the incident happens, we immediately want to be notified and take immediate action. Example: fire alarm.</li>
<li>- Post Identification: If operative identification is not possible, we want the get the information as soon as possible. Log files and passive alerts (e-mails by crontab).</li>
<li>- Evidence Based Identification: Security elements added to IT assets to check integrity/confidentiality.<br />
				Examples: Signatures on paper documents, checksums on files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>* Proving the incident happened (later)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Classification of Safeguards by IT Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Physical assets</li>
<li>Information / data</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>Ability to reproduce a product/service</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Intangible aspects</li>
</ul>
<h3>Components of organizational safeguards</h3>
<ul>
<li>Activities that someone must do</li>
<li>Activities that are prohibited for certain persons</li>
<li>Sanctions for doing something prohibited</li>
<li>Sanctions for not doing something that must be done</li>
</ul>
