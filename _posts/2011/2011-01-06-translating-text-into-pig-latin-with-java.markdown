I have a beginner level Java exam coming up tomorrow and I&#039;m doing some last-minute studying. Here&#039;s a primitive Java program I wrote to translate English text into [Pig Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

It has some obvious shortcomings like lacking validity checks and inability to handle symbols.

The program is text based. It asks for a file, reads it, loops over individual words and outputs and writes the resulting translation.
