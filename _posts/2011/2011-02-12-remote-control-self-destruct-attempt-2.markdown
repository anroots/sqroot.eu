I took another crack at my geeky idea - creating a remotely activated self destruct script. (Python / shell)

How it works:&nbsp;SMS -&gt; PHP controller script with my message in GET request -&gt; Message stored in file -&gt; Periodic controller script running in PC -&gt; if file contains something, execute and reset it.


The &quot;Self destruct&quot; isn&#039;t quite fancy, basically it just wipes the MBR.
