Since the invention of e-mail, geeky people have found various creative and sometimes annoying ways to notify themselves of a new mail in their inbox.

Say, for example, that you have a roomie who left his laptop locked and the volume up and it just so happens that he had a very vocal Indian dude announcing his full inbox every 3 minutes.

* Step 1: Hack into said roomies computer
* Step 2: Locate and download said MP3 announcement file
* Step 3: Modify the file to your liking or [download mine]({{ site.url }}/content/2011/04/west.wav)
* Step 4: Replace the old MP3 file with your better version
* Step 5: Profit
