I was travelling in a bus with free WiFi and needed some music. My go to solution? Youtube. Surprisingly, the bus company had blocked the domain, probably to avoid freeloaders like me overloading the network.

Since I don't like censorship and thought streaming music (without video) to be fair use, I took it as a challenge.

Here's how you can bypass domain blocks without a personal <a href="http://visual.ly/what-consumer-vpn">VPN</a> (you should get a VPN). You'll need...<br />

<ol>
<li>Some basic knowledge of the command line.</li>
<li>Software: <a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle">apenwarr / sshuttle</a> (a transparent proxy server)</li>
<li>SSH access to a remote server. Tip: lots of universities provide students with SSH accounts.</li>
</ol>

<h1>A poor mans VPN</h1>

Download and run sshuttle. The guide is in the README of the GitHub repository, but it should go somewhere along the lines of...

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle.git
$ cd sshuttle
$ ./sshuttle --dns -r anroots@enos.itcollege.ee 0/0
```

The `--dns` flag is important. Replace `anroots@enos.itcollege.ee` with your login and server and enjoy unfiltered access.
