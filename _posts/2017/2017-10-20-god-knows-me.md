I was walking in Leicester Square today when this man stopped me for a chat.

- "Where do you think you will be when you die?"
- "Nowhere, I 'suppose"
- .... sth sth sth God sth sth belive sth sth life is brief, but eternity is long sth sth God sth sth.... You're from Estonia, right?
- ....whaaat?
- Where are you from?
- Estonia
- See! God knows you!
- ....

So, basically, a random believer, whom I had never met, in a city of 9 million, knew my nationality, because God speaks to him, apparently. And He could speak to me, too, if only...

I had no identifying marks on my person, nor did I mention any clues to my nationality in our previous, short, philosophical conversation.
How do you 'suppose that came to happen? I was caught off guard and accepted the religious, free book (but did not promise anything).

However, I am a hacker and I like interesting problems. So, I watched the man, as he went about his business. Funny thing, he was standing in the middle of a very busy street, with lots of potential non-believers, waiting to be converted, but he was looking at his phone 95% of the time.

What interesting messages from The All Mighty was this device delivering to him?

Let me introduce the reader to the fabulous world of [Open Source Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence).
Chances are, the Interwebs are full with public data about you. Try it: enter your details to [pipl.com](https://pipl.com) - chances are, you have an online presence. I certainly do, as my chosen profession requires it.

So, my theories:

- He had a partner, who, perhaps, a couple of hundred feet before him, took pictures of strangers and tried to [reverse-image-search](https://tineye.com/) passerby's. Then, having successfully identified someone and found a public fact about them, he forwarded the details and image to his accomplish, who was ready to stop the pictured individual, armed with this fact.
- Same, as (1), but the accomplish (or he) used advanced radio intelligence: I had Bluetooth turned on and was Roaming. Perhaps there's a geolocation-aware Bluetooth MAC address database or the 4G radio protocol leaks the Roamer's country of origin.
- I did indeed have a Tell, which I was not aware of and the Believer was good at reading people / social engineering. This does not explain the phone-time, however.

Religion does indeed develop with technology. Perhaps there's a handy ConverterApp.

Have you encountered this tactic beforehand? Do you have any theories on how he could have OSI-d me (quickly)?

*Update (2017-10-24): As suggested by commentators, my leading theory is identifying English accent from my part. However, this does not explain why he was so engaged with his phone.*

_(This is not intended to be offensive about religion as a concept, in particular. I am a bit crossed about this specific tactic of conversion as I don't like to be social engineered / OSI-d.)_
