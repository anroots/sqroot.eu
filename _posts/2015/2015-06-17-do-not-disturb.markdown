title: 'Open Office And Interruptions? Post A "Go Away!" Sign'

I work in an open office environment where there is constant noise and people coming over to ask questions. As a not-so-subtle reminder that
I am a knowledge worker and interruptions are [very bad for the focused programmer RAM](http://thetomorrowlab.com/2015/01/why-developers-hate-being-interrupted/), I decided to post an educational sign warning people to go away.

I built a rectangular box, open from the front, using foam sheets, cutting tools and glue. I added aluminium foil to the inside of the box (for increased light output), glued on some LED strips (12V) and built a simple light "bulb" / bar from them. A 12V power adapter connects to the box with a power connector. An ON/OFF switch can be used to toggle its state.

The box has four magnets in the corners. I have four additional magnets that can be used to attach different A4 paper signs to it (kind of like putting sign on a whiteboard with magnets). I wrote and printed different A4 signs with a large font, on half-transparent A4 paper.

The result was a light-box with switchable signs. It went up behind my desk at the office. People were pleasantly surprised (cool project, bro!).

The project was meant as a quick prototype. The construction of the box is rudimentary (rough edges). Originally I wanted the ON/OFF switch to be based on capacitive sensing (no visible switch, you just touch the box and it toggles itself on/off), but decided to go with the quicker route.
