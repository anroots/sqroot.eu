I wrote the following Python script to solve my need to verify all my projects are still up and running. The program itself is simple: given a list of URL-s check that all of them return HTTP status code 200 (OK). On any other status (mainly 500) send a report to the admin.
Best used via crontab every... minutes.
Install: Copy both files to a directory (~/bin works well) and check that dependencies (imports) are satisfied. Configure via http_check.yaml, optionally adding custom actions to http_ok() and http_error() functions inside the main script file.
