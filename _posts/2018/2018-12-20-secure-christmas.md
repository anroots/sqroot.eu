I received solstice greetings via snail-mail from fellow security engineers in [Bigbank](https://bigbank.eu), guys I used to work with.
Only, when ethical hackers send messages, they send them... securely.

The outer envilope was marked as registrered mail. Inside:

- Security stickers, because, obviously
- A merry fir tree card
    - ...but you had to enable macros to get it to show
- Security envelope, properly sealed with a security seal
    - Inside, an USB drive

## USB teardown

The USB drive was named "[nimda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimda)" (`__<<admin` - RTL override?) and contained `insecurity.png`.

insecurity.png: PNG image data, 300 x 300, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced
```


So, it is (actually) a `300x300px` .PNG image. The obvious question though - WTF is up with the `867M` file size?
Interestingly, Nautilus had no problems displaying the thumbnail.

It's my avatar.

Maybe the guys used [PNG metadata](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11textinfo) to hide a hidden message or artificially
enlarge the file size? [Let's inspect](/content/2018/secure-christmas/metadata.txt) with

```bash
$ identify -verbose insecurity.png
```

Seems like not. What about `hexdump`, this should give an indication of what's actually there...

```bash
$ hexdump -C insecurity.png -n 90000 | less
```

{% responsive_image path: content/2018/secure-christmas/png-hex1.png alt="PNG hexdump" %}

The file starts with a `.png` image, as expected. This is why Nautilus was able to render the thumbnail.
However, scrolling down, we see that at one point not far into the file, the file ends with
`IEND` marker, which [according to .PNG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IEND),
"marks the end of the PNG datastream".

What follows makes it clear why the file was so large.

The guys have hidden the latest `.iso` of Kali Linux into the `.PNG` file.

Have you ever thought how to hide your hacking distros? An image* will do.

## Card teardown

The printed-out card they sent had two sides: one Word document, directing the user to
enable content, the other wishing merry Christmas.

Most people don't know this, but whenever you print something with a color printer, the printer
[embeds tiny tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code)
[fingerprints in the paper](http://seeingyellow.com/), in yellow color.
You won't be able to see it with a naked eye, but in case it's ever needed,
this marker will be able to identify from which printer a particular paper came from.
This is how they were able to [identify a whistleblower in NSA](https://mashable.com/2017/06/06/printer-dots-nsa-leak).

Let's see if the markers (or any other hidden messages) are present in the card.

We'll start by taking a high-resolution scan (best quality possible `<600dpi`) of the paper.

The resulting `.PDF` can be opened in Gimp.

Using he color Channels dialog, we'll hide the Red and Green color channels, leaving only the blue.
And zoom in.

{% responsive_image path: content/2018/secure-christmas/gimp2.png alt="Card scan in Gimp" %}

Looking closely, we can see tiny black dots with the same pattern, distributed across the page.
Zooming in on one of them gives us the unique fingerprint of the printer in questions.

So, if you ever receive printouts with the same fingerprint, you know it came from their printer.

All-in-all, an excellent hackish solstice wish. Thanks, guys!
