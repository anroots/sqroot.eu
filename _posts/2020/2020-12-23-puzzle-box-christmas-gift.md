Here's a gift box I built for this Christmas. A wooden box, locked with a combination lock. To get the code of the lock (and the gift inside),
one has to solve how to open the box.


## Why do this

I wanted to make obtaining the gift just a bit challening - this would make the reward more satisfying. Idea of a locked box w/ combination
lock fit the bill well, as making a puzzle to disclose a password is doable enough. Oddly, I couldn't find a small lockable box from local nor
online stores, so I built one.

## The build

I'm no woodworker, and did this in the living room, with limited tooling available. The build is rough.
I discovered plenty of small tips how to make my next box cleaner, but that's for another time.
