Apparently, microcontrollers are dangerous and/or privileged goods and the US government needs a solemn promise that they won't be used for "bad purposes".

Hello,

Here are the answers to the five questions. I solemnly swear that I am up to only good.

1. No, but I will post the schematics and code that I will use along with this item to The Internet. Technically, this information is accessible from ALL countries (1). What is more, the schematic for the item itself is [already published by the manufacturer](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/schematic.html)
2. No, although we Estonians have compulsory military service and one could argue that using the Teensy to educate myself will improve my performance in the military
3. Yes, although it is not within my power to guarantee who will ultimately recycle The Item or its Components
4. The item will be used to build a self-made, touch-sensitive computer keyboard. Probably within a wooden frame, but I am unwilling to testify on this point. This claim can be verified by following [my blog](https://sqroot.eu), where I will post the build log for this project as soon as I complete it. To the best of my knowledge, I will violate no US patents by building the non-explosive device myself, instead of buying one from Apple.
5. Milky Way, Earth, Europe, European Union, The Republic of Estonia, Harjumaa, Tallinn. I have already submitted my shipping address; although this is subject to change in a year or so.

(1) If they haven't censored my blog and/or Github (2)
(2) ...but they might use a VPN to bypass the censorship (3)
(3) ...unless The Country blocks VPN too


I apologize for the snark (somewhat), but this is my response to the sillyness of classifying a microcontroller as restricted goods. Kind of reminds the "[Encryption is munition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States)" idea from the 90's.

The best,
A

I found this amusing, annoying and well, pointless: how will my "promise" stop me from doing something _bad_, selling the device to someone who might do something _bad_ or be legally binding in any way (considering e-mail is not authenticated nor legally binding).

So, just in case, I signed my reply with [Estonian digital signature](http://id.ee/?lang=en).

What an odd world to be a maker in.
