My brother is going to serve his mandatory term in the army in a few months - so I thought I'd put together a "starter kit" of all the necessities I found useful during my service.

Below is a list of items included in the backpack and a brief explanation for the ones whose usage might not be immediately obvious. All items are chosen with utility and portability in mind: instead of getting on huge can of shaving foam, choose a small, but compact one.
