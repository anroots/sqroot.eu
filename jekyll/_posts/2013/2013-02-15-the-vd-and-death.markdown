The TV Show, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries">The Vampire Diaries</a>" kills people. A lot... except they are not strictly speaking people... but sometimes they are. I am a bit disturbed and crossed: is death really the main attraction of the show?

The first season was just fine, the story was exciting and somewhat more true to L.J. Smith's original book. Lately, however...

I like good storytelling. A solid plot. Deep characters. I want to be pleasantly surprised and drawn into a rich fantasy world. The VD had some of that... but it kind of sort of gradually faded. What I see now is glamourous, care-free life, shallow relationship drama and bloody death. Lots of it.

Death is supposed to be something profound. Once it hits, it's game over. Very few get a second chance. Fantasy allows us to get outside that limitation for a while, but limits should be set even then. When you do something extraordinary enough times, it becomes the new norm.

There have been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHV8-q23Lis">good death scenes</a> in the show - moments that focus on the dying character as a person and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CvHMGR8HYk">emotional trauma</a> that goes with the passing of a loved one. Just, please... don't discard a mass murder with a bit of sarcasm and "scared" faces. Human lives mean a bit more than that.

I suppose the show caters to its intended audience... but I don't belong to that group for a while now.
