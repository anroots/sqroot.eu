The software development industry is full of buzz-words. It seems that the more you use them in your recruitment ads, the cooler and more tech-savvy you are.

Here's my list of extracted "cool phrases" from Pipedrive's "[Looking for a Back-End Developer](http://blog.pipedrive.com/2015/03/back-end-developer)" text.

* best sales software

* most epic, innovative sales management mobile solution
* smart, passionate, and capable software engineers
* make an impact in the real world
* bleeding edge technology
* central point of integration

* challenging, stimulating startup environment
* work independently
* deliver high quality code in a timely manner
* product engagements

That's ~40% of the original text. I'm not saying that's good. I'm not saying that's bad... but looking at (and sometimes writing) those texts gets not fun after some years.

The question in my mind is: aren't you setting yourself (both as the company [for living up to those promises] and as the candidate [gosh, I'm a shy introvert, should I even apply?]) up for really high expectations? What if I've already worked in a company that promised all of that and made me quit after a year to escape the legacy code, corporate ass-kicking and more?

Perhaps recruiting should be like dating: you're more attracted not towards the one who starts jabbering away, but to the one who says a few simple lines, then listens, then responds with an honest reply.

*Sorry -> Pipedrive for picking specifically on you.*
