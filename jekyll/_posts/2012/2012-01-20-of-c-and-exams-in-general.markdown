This post marks the end of my 3rd semester in the <a href="http://itcollege.ee">best IT university in Estonia</a>. The subject? Programming in C#. The exam? Awesome.
What ever do I mean? How could an exam be anything but excruciating? Let me explain by telling you why I became (<a href="https://sqroot.eu/2011/be-a-developer-not-a-programmer/">more precicely, want to become</a>) a developer.
Development is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">creative</span> field and as with any other similar subject - be it painting, composing or even cooking - offers a certain amount of satisfaction, both during and after a problem is tackled.
It took me a while to figure this out. Skip back half a decade to my high-school years. I kept putting off studying Russian in favour of solving math problems by writing algorithms (the odd thing was that I wasn't  really fond of math during the time). Thinking back, it's obvious why I did it. The process of problem-solving was far more interesting and rewarding than all those pesky (<em>useless</em>) grammar rules or even the end result, the algorithm.
Passion, of course, changes everything: dull problems become exciting and the goal changes from the big finish to the journey.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that coding is never dull when done by passionate people... and so, neither is an exam.
The source code for my assignment can be seen <a href="https://github.com/anroots/ITK-projects/tree/master/C%23/Eksam/">over @ GitHub</a> (with the instructors permission). The solution was praised and graded 100%.
