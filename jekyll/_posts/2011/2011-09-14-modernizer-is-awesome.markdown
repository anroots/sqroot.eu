I absolutely HATE supporting IE &lt; 9 designs. It&#039;s tedious, frustrating and no fun at all.

I&#039;m designing for HTML5 and CSS3&nbsp;(the &quot;new&quot; web <strong>is</strong> here <strong>now</strong>) and nearly always use the new features both language upgrades bring to modern, sensible browsers.

That&#039;s why I&#039;ve been using <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizer</a> as part of the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>&nbsp;suite by Paul Irish.

# Modernizer To the Resque!

> Modernizr is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites.

At first, I took it&#039;s promise for automagical&nbsp;compatibility improvements with ehem... older browsers... at trust... but then I fired up my virtual machine and saw the real difference.

Below are 3 pictures of a design I am creating in HTML based on specs from the designer. You decide: is <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizer</a> 2.0 worth the 10 kilobytes of JS?

# The Morale

Include CSS reset and HTML5 Boilerplate (or similar) in your design. Really, it helps. A lot.
