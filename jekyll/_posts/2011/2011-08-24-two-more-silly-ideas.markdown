  content: Wow, thanks! That&#039;s typical me by the way. Check out my Portfolio,
    it&#039;s full of stuff just like that. Small projects that are good on paper
    but that I never finish 100%. So I thought to jot down the ideas, maybe someone
    with the willpower wants to try instead.

  content: I have already seen your portfolio. :) But I really like these ideas, especially
    the first one. It&#039;s really brilliant and useful.

# QuickThoughts

![QuickThoughts]({{ site.url }}/content/2011/08/quick.png)

Design Reviews often take up a lot of time but really, it&#039;s about first impressions. Is that font unreadably small? Who thought it a good idea to put that obscure graphic there?

QuickThoughts to the resque! You can upload a snapshot of your mockup and share the link with those whose opinion matters. They have <strong>30</strong> seconds to look at it and up to two minutes to write down their first impressions which You then use to improve the design.

I&#039;ve set up a Kohana installation and coded the backbone of it. Now it&#039;s just the matter of coding in some usability features and doing something with the appearance of the site. In short, it&#039;s the question of exactly how lazy I am. I never seem to finish a project past this stage.

# Assoc
Inspired by improv and <a href="http://oneword.com/">http://oneword.com/</a>. Basically just some JavaScript to bombard the visitor with random words at a very rapid pace. The words are written with a BIG font, on a green/red background.

The goal of the game is to react to the words by thinking of another word. There is no scoreboard. For example, if the visitor sees the word &#039;cat&#039; on a green background, he must think of a word associated with cat, like &#039;dog&#039;. When the background is red, the word must be completely unrelated, like &#039;spaceshuttle&#039;.

As soon as the word is found, the visitor presses the spacebar and is presented with another challenge.

Feel free to steal the ideas and code it yourself. Just drop a link to the implementation.
