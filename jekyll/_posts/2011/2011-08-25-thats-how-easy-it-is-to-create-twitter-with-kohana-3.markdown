<a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> has become my PHP framework of choice ever since I was forced to start using it about 9 months ago. Derived from <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> (<em>interestingly enough I can&#039;t confirm that since, once again, Kohana&#039;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohana_%28web_framework%29">Wikipedia page</a></em> <em>has been deleted</em>), Kohana has made several advancements and is now a fully capable framework I&#039;ve come to love.


This article shows one of the reasons for that, namely how quick, easy and (arguably) elegant it is to create a web app from scratch using Kohana. The app we&#039;ll build is an extremely basic one, but coding it from scratch, without a framework... I don&#039;t even want to imagine.


The post is in the form of a tutorial and I&#039;ll write as if giving instructions to You.

# Project Summary

We&#039;ll be building a very basic Twitter-type microblog application. The main functionalities of the site include:

<ul>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Making a micro-post <em>(ie tweeting)</em></li>
<li>Viewing a list of past micro-posts</li>
<li>Deleting a post</li>
<li>Logging out</li>
</ul>

We&#039;ll use Twitter&#039;s own <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap toolkit</a> <em>(hey, what the heck, we&#039;re stealing their bread anyhow, why not in guns blazing?)</em> that does all the heavy lifting on the CSS / design part. We won&#039;t be using any Javascript since that would be a post on it&#039;s own.

# Conclusion

Now that you&#039;ve spent some hours (it took me 3 hours to write the fully-working code <a href="https://github.com/anroots/kohana-twitter">you see @ github</a>) building the app, all you need to do is hire some marketing people and travel back in time 8-or-so years - the riches await.
