I've been around and fascinated by computers from my early teens. What started out as a fun hobby has turned into an exciting and challenging career.

I specialize in backend web development mainly with PHP and the LAMP stack. HTTP JSON API-s are of particular interest to me and that's what I do in my day-job at Bigbank. I love to learn new technologies, frameworks and better ways of doing things. I also love sharing what I know with others.

On my free time I'm a somewhat experienced improviser. You can see me on stage ~twice a month, performing unscripted theater with [Improgrupp Jaa!](http://jaa.ee). I perform, teach and travel around festivals in Europe.

My favorite past-time for Fridays and weekends is to work on a private software or hardware project. Most of it is open sourced at GitHub. I enjoy running, orchestral music and coffee that's done just right.
